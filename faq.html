<h2>Junior Ambassador Program</h2>


<ol>	

		<li><span class="faq-question">How many chaperones go with the students?</span>
			<p><p>The student/chaperone ratio is typically 5:1. Chaperones are either Bloomington-Normal committee members or educators from the Bloomington-Normal community.</p></p>
		</li>
		


		<li><span class="faq-question">How many students go on the trip?</span>
			<p><p>We need a minimum of 4 students for the trip. The maximum number of students is 15.</p></p>
		</li>
		


		<li><span class="faq-question">What do the students do in Japan?</span>
			<p><p>The trip is approximately 2 weeks long in June. In addition to experiencing living with host families and getting a glimpse of typical Japanese life, students participate in activities including: visiting Asahikawa junior high and high schools, visiting local industries, meeting the mayor, participating in cultural events, outdoor activities, and hands-on activities (wood carving, flower arranging, sushi making, judo, etc.).</p></p>
		</li>
		


		<li><span class="faq-question">What is included in the cost?</span>
			<p><p>The cost includes round trip airfare from Bloomington to Hokkaido, Japan, overnight hotel accommodation (if necessary, when traveling to/from Japan), ground transportation throughout the trip, most meals, costs associated with activities or admittance fee, a t-shirt, and pre-trip training materials.</p></p>
		</li>
		


		<li><span class="faq-question">What do the pre-departure orientation sessions include?</span>
			<p><p>Pre-trip meetings will be held which will set expectations for the trip, start basic language training, and give the students an opportunity to ask questions. These meetings will also give the students and chaperones a chance to get to know each other. These meetings will consist of Japanese language lessons (greetings, self-introduction, simple phrases), Japanese cultural lessons (do and don'ts, etc.), and basic travel preparations (what to pack, etc.). Students will also learn some history about Bloomington-Normal, McLean County, Illinois and the USA as well as Asahikawa, Japan. Finally, the students will also prepare a presentation, usually a song or dance, to be performed at the Welcome Party in Asahikawa; this is a tradition in our exchange program.</p></p>
		</li>
		


		<li><span class="faq-question">Are students allowed to communicate with parents during travel?</span>
			<p><p>Yes, if needed. Students will call parents to notify them of safe arrival and when they are departing from Asahikawa. A chaperone will communicate regularly with the trip coordinator in Bloomington-Normal. That person will be in touch with parents if concerns arise. The chaperones will also send periodic updates through emails or Facebook posts.</p></p>
		</li>
		


		<li><span class="faq-question">Where do the students stay?</span>
			<p><p>Each student will stay with a local Asahikawa host family. Host families usually have children and it is highly likely that the host family will have limited English knowledge.</p></p>
		</li>
		


		<li><span class="faq-question">What if a student gets sick?</span>
			<p><p>If a student is sick, the chaperone and an Asahikawa committee member will accompany the student to a doctor. The student or committee member will need to pay out of pocket and then submit receipts to the insurance company for reimbursement.</p></p>
		</li>
		
				</ol>
		
<h2>High School Exchange Program</h2>


<ol>	

		<li><span class="faq-question">Who is eligible for this program?</span>
			<p><p>This program is funded by the City of Bloomington and the Town of Normal; therefore, to be eligible for this program the student must currently be a high school freshman, sophomore, or junior who lives in District 87 or Unit 5. Students do not have to attend a District 87 or Unit 5 school; they only have to live in the district. Current seniors are not eligible.</p></p>
		</li>
		


		<li><span class="faq-question">When will the student leave for Japan? When will the student return?</span>
			<p><p>
	The student will be in Asahikawa for 10 months, departing in early August and returning in mid-June. The exchange student is not allowed to return early for graduation. The student must stay until mid-June to complete the 10 month program.</p></p>
		</li>
		


		<li><span class="faq-question">What is included in this scholarship?</span>
			<p><p>The scholarship award includes transportation to and from Japan, living costs, high school tuition and fees, a school uniform, and a monthly stipend.</p></p>
		</li>
		


		<li><span class="faq-question">How are the Japanese high school credits arranged to meet local requirements?</span>
			<p><p>
	It depends on the school and the counselor. Before departure, the selected student and parents are responsible for meeting with their high school counselor to discuss what subjects the student should take in Japan in order for the credits to transfer for graduation. Previous exchange students could transfer all or most credits to local high schools and were able to graduate with their classmates.</p></p>
		</li>
		


		<li><span class="faq-question">What arrangements are made for medical care?</span>
			<p><p>The student should continue to be covered under the parent(s) health insurance here in the U.S. Parents should contact the insurance company to make sure that the student has medical coverage while he/she is out of the country. (Sometimes it requires a special rider.) The Asahikawa Sister Cities Committee will buy the national health insurance for the student. Usually a patient will pay 30% of the cost. Medical costs are much less in Japan than in the U.S. You may be reimbursed by your American insurance company. The Asahikawa Sister Cities Committee will take the student to an English speaking doctor.</p></p>
		</li>
		


		<li><span class="faq-question">What training will the student receive before leaving for Japan?</span>
			<p><p>The student is required to take Japanese language lessons once or twice a week with homework assigned for the approximately 9 months leading up to their departure. The student will also study Japanese customs and culture as well as learn about Bloomington and Normal.</p></p>
		</li>
		


		<li><span class="faq-question">What is the student’s obligation to the Sister Cities Committee while in Japan and after returning?</span>
			<p><p>While in Asahikawa the student is expected to not only be a great ambassador for our community, but for the United States as well. The student should be respectful, polite, friendly, active, and diligent in their studies, especially their studies of the Japanese language. The student will probably be asked to give speeches at special events, and help with special projects. The student is required to send monthly reports to the Bloomington-Normal Committee without delay. After returning to Bloomington-Normal, the student will also be expected to assist the committee in promoting the exchange program by attending informational meetings, making public presentations, participating in public relations activities, writing a final report, etc.</p></p>
		</li>
		


		<li><span class="faq-question">Where will the student stay while in Asahikawa?</span>
			<p><p>The student will stay with three or four different host families. Usually the first host family will have at least one member who speaks some English.</p></p>
		</li>
		


		<li><span class="faq-question">How does the student get to school?</span>
			<p><p>Asahikawa schools do not provide school buses. Depending on where the host family lives and the season, the student may go to school by bicycle or ride a city bus or a train A bicycle or bus/train passes will be supplied by Asahikawa Sister City Committee.</p></p>
		</li>
		


		<li><span class="faq-question">Can family visit the student while in Japan?</span>
			<p><p>It is suggested that if parents plan to visit, it should be done in or after spring break, the end of March. This is to help the student fully transition and acclimate to life in Japan. The family should notify the Sister Cities Committees if they do choose to visit. The committee discourages boyfriends and girlfriends from visiting.</p></p>
