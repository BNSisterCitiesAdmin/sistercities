		<h3>High School Host Families</h3>
		<p><p>Couples or families typically host a student for three months or more. The ideal host family is eager to share aspects of American life with the student while being open to learning about other cultures. </p><p>Host parents are interviewed by the committee and by law must complete a background check. Host parents that are selected are expected to sign a contract with the committee, promising to fulfill certain obligations, and are provided with a set of rules that govern the conduct and expectations of the students.</p></p>

		<h3>Junior High Host Families</h3>
		<p><p>amilies are needed each March for approximately one week to host a junior high student.</p><p>The ideal host family is excited to expose the student to typical American life by being warm and welcoming. During the week, host families will be responsible for picking up and dropping off their student for daily committee arranged activities, attending the welcome and farewell parties, and spending time with the student during the evenings and weekend.</p></p>

		<figcaption class="pullquote"><p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> <p>"Being a member of the Bloomington-Normal Asahikawa Sister Cities committee allows me to support international travel and cultural immersion for young students from both the Twin Cities and Asahikawa, Japan. This student exchange is a life-changing experience for all of the young people who are able to participate. I firmly believe in the hands-on life experience this committee facilitates for young people."</p><p>- Mary Anne Schierman</p><p>"The program is amazing because it helps so many students to learn about another culture on a much deeper level than some other programs. Being able to live with a family while attending school gives a much deeper insight to the people and culture itself. It also gives those in Asahikawa the chance to learn about us and spend time with someone they may never have had an opportunity to meet."</p><p>- Ryan Apple</p><p>"I worked in Japan for two years and want to give back to the Japanese people who were so kind and gracious to me."</p><p>- Patrick Clapper</p><p>"We are increasingly living in a global community. What we do here in Bloomington-Normal can affect so much outside our cities and our country. It's important for our residents to experience other cultures to develop a sense of that global community and to feel connected to other people in the world. The more we experience other cultures, the more we can empathize with others that may not be exactly like us and be open to the world overall."</p><p>- Dawn McBride</p><p>"Let's make friends through Bloomington-Normal Asahikawa Sister Cities programs!"</p><p>- Chiko Tsukamoto</p> <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p></figcaption>
