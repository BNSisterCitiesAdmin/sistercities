			<p><p>The Junior Ambassador Program is a short term exchange for American students to Asahikawa, Japan and for Japanese students to Bloomington-Normal. </p><p>Every June, up to 15 students from Unit 5 or District 87 who have completed 7th - 10th grade can participate in a trip to Asahikawa, Japan. A main aspect of this trip is that during their time in Japan, students will live with Japanese host families. Students will be expected to readily engage with their host family during their stay in order to make the most out of this unique experience. In addition to staying with host families, students will participate in a variety of activities in Asahikawa. Prior to departure, participating students will be required to attend multiple orientation sessions to learn basic Japanese language phrases, customs, and to cover important travel preparations. The trip usually costs between $2000 - $2500 for nearly 17 days of travel (depending on airfare pricing). Watch the website for the informational session(s) to learn more about this amazing trip.</p><p>Just as we take students to Japan, our sister city, Asahikawa, sends up to 15 junior high students from their community to Bloomington-Normal every year. Students stay with host families in Bloomington-Normal for about 1 week at the end of March to the beginning of April. Host families show the students what typical American life is like while simultaneously learning about Japanese culture from the students. While visiting, the Japanese students see many attractions and take part in various daily activities during each weekday of their trip. There will be more information posted about how your family can host a student and share in this enriching experience. </p><p>If you would like to be contacted about being a host family in the future, please fill out this form.</p><p data-children-count="0"><br></p><hr><p>The trip from Asahikawa usually takes place the last week of March and first week of April during spring break in Japan. </p><p>We need host families for those students during their approximately 10 day stay. Due to the pandemic, there is currently no trip planned for 2022. Updates will be posted accordingly.</p></p>
